This repository contains sample SwiftUI views.

## SignInView

The `SignInView` provides a dark-themed sign-in form inspired by the Uber app. It includes email and password fields and a prominent sign‑in button. This view can be used as a starting point for authentication screens in SwiftUI applications.


## Onboarding Views

The `OnboardingAccountChoiceView` demonstrates a multi-step onboarding flow. It lets users agree to terms, choose between creating a new account or using an existing one, and showcases supporting screens for entering an email address and name. Buttons now navigate through the flow: the back buttons dismiss the current view, “Next” advances to the following screen, and choosing the existing account option opens the sign‑in form. These views are built with SwiftUI and can be used as a starting point for onboarding experiences.
